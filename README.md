### About.
This is one of my first projects I have created using the above technologies. 
Taking me around a day to create the bare bones of the site and implement an animated navbar
which will highlight one of the three sections on the site 'home, specs, contact'.

The main issue I had with this page was figuring out how to get the animation to work
and how to get the JS to see when a new section is 65% into the the viewport. To get around this issue
I consulted various documentation from 'developer.mozilla.org' and also 'stackoverflow.com' to troubleshoot my issues.

#### Thank you for reading.
